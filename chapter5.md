## First Step of Model Building

Till now, we have looked at the data exploartion, cleaning, feature engineering and pre processing steps of model building. Now, we will look at the methods of building a model. 

In this challengs "Loan Prediction", we need to identify customer whose loan status 


*** =instructions
- Use train.apply(lambda x: sum(x.isnull()),axis=0) with comparison operator to check variable has missing value or not
- Look at frequency distribution of Gender to identify more frequent category


*** =hint
- Use sum(train.apply(lambda x: sum(x.isnull()),axis=0) > 0) to check count of variable having missing values 
- Use median() inplace of mean() in expression train['Loan_Amount_Term'].fillna(train['Loan_Amount_Term'].median(), inplace=True) to impute with median


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}

# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# Import library pandas
import pandas as pd

# Import training file
train = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/train.csv")

# Import testing file
test = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/test.csv")

```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# Training and Testing data set is loaded in variable train and test dataframe respectively

# Number of variables with missing values
variables_missing_value = 


# Impute missing value of Loan_Amount_Term with median


# Impute missing value of Gender with more frequent category

 

```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Training and Testing data set is loaded in variable train and test dataframe respectively

# Number of variables with missing values
variables_missing_value = sum(train.apply(lambda x: sum(x.isnull()),axis=0) > 0)


# Impute missing value of Loan_Amount_Term with median
train['Loan_Amount_Term'].fillna(train['Loan_Amount_Term'].median(), inplace=True)

# Impute missing value of Gender with more frequent category
train['Self_Employed'].fillna('No',inplace=True)

```

*** =sct

```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Number of variables with missing values
test_object("variables_missing_value")

# Impute missing value of Loan_Amount_Term with median


# Impute missing value of Gender with more frequent category


success_msg("Great work!")
