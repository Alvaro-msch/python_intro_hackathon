## How to approach a challenge?

The model development cycle goes through various stages, starting from data collection to model building. Most of us admits that data exploration needs more attention to unleasehed the hidden story of data but before exploring the data to understand relationships (in variables), It’s always recommended to perform hypothesis generation. (To know more  about hypothesis generation, refer to <a href =" http://discuss.analyticsvidhya.com/t/why-and-when-is-hypothesis-generation-important/2109"> this link</a>). 

It is important that you spend time thinking on the given problem and gaining the domain knowledge. So, how does it help?

This practice usually helps in building better features later on, which are not biased by the data available in the data-set. This is a crucial step which usually improves a model’s accuracy.

At this stage, you are expected to apply structured thinking to the problem i.e. a thinking process which takes into consideration all the possible aspects of a particular problem.


####Which of the following has the right order of model building life cycle?


*** =instructions
- Data Collection --> Data Exploration --> Hypothesis Generation --> Model Building --> Prediction
- Data Collection --> Hypothesis Generation --> Data Exploration --> Model Building --> Prediction
- Hypothesis Generation --> Data Collection --> Data Exploration --> Model Building --> Prediction

*** =hint
Always perform hypothesis generation before data collection and exploration, it also helps you to collect right data

*** =sct
```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package

msg_bad1 = "Think again!"
msg_success = "Exactly! we always do Hypothesis generation before data collection and exploration"

# Use test_mc() to grade multiple choice exercises. 
# Pass the correct option (Action, option 2 in the instructions) to correct.
# Pass the feedback messages, both positive and negative, to feedback_msgs in the appropriate order.
test_mc(3, [msg_bad1, msg_bad1, msg_success]) 
```

## Feature Engineering

This step helps to extract more information from existing data. New information is extracted in terms of new features. These features may have a higher ability to explain the variance in the training data. Thus, giving improved model accuracy.

Feature engineering is highly influenced by hypotheses generation. Good hypothesis results into good feature. That’s why, experts always suggest to invest quality time in hypothesis generation. Feature engineering process can be divided into two steps:

* Feature Transformation
* Feature Creation

##### Feature Transformation: 

There are various scenarios where feature transformation is required:
* Changing the scale of a variable from original scale to scale between zero and one.
* Some algorithms works well with normally distributed data. Therefore, we must remove skewness of variable(s). There are methods like log, square root or inverse of the values to remove skewness
* Binning of numerical variables

##### Feature Creation: 

Deriving new variable(s) from existing variables is known as feature creation. It helps to unleash the hidden relationship of a data set. Let’s say, we want to predict the number of transactions in a store based on transaction dates. Here transaction dates may not have direct correlation with number of transaction, but if we look at the day of a week, it may have a higher correlation. In this case, the information about day of a week is hidden. We need to extract it to make the model better.

#### Creating a variable based on mathematical computation of existing three variables is a method of?

msg_bad1 = "Think again!"
msg_success = "Yes! Creating a new feature out of existing ones is known as feature creation"

# Use test_mc() to grade multiple choice exercises. 
# Pass the correct option (Action, option 2 in the instructions) to correct.
# Pass the feedback messages, both positive and negative, to feedback_msgs in the appropriate order.
test_mc(2, [msg_bad1, msg_success, msg_bad1]) 
```

## Feature Selection

Feature Selection is a process of finding out the best subset of attributes which better explains the relationship of independent variables with target variable.

You can select the useful features based on various metrics like:

* Domain Knowledge: Based on domain experience, we select feature(s) which may have higher impact on target variable.
* Visualization: As the name suggests, it helps to visualize the relationship between variables, which makes your variable selection process easier.
* Statistical Parameters: We also consider the p-values, information values and other statistical metrics to select right features.

#### Variable importance table of random forest classifier can act as feature selection tool?

# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package

msg_bad1 = "Think again!"
msg_success = "Yes! Creating a new feature out of existing ones is known as feature creation"

# Use test_mc() to grade multiple choice exercises. 
# Pass the correct option (Action, option 2 in the instructions) to correct.
# Pass the feedback messages, both positive and negative, to feedback_msgs in the appropriate order.
test_mc(1, [msg_success, msg_bad1]) 
```

## How to select the right value of model parameter?

We know that machine learning algorithms are driven by parameters. These parameters majorly influence the outcome of learning process.

The objective of parameter tuning is to find the optimum value for each parameter to improve the accuracy of the model. To tune these parameters, you must have a good understanding of their meaning and individual impact on model. You can repeat this process with a number of well performing models.

For example: In random forest, we have various parameters like max_features, number_trees, random_state, oob_score and others. Intuitive optimization of these parameter values will result in better and more accurate models.

#### Which of the following is not a parameter of random forest algorithm (in Scikit Learn)?


*** =instructions
- max_depth
- max_leaf_node
- learning rate
- max_features

*** =pre_exercise_code


*** =sct
```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package

msg_bad1 = "Look at the hint to know more about parameters of random forest"
msg_success = "Good Job!"

# Use test_mc() to grade multiple choice exercises. 
# Pass the correct option (Action, option 2 in the instructions) to correct.
# Pass the feedback messages, both positive and negative, to feedback_msgs in the appropriate order.
test_mc(3, [msg_bad1, msg_bad1, msg_success, msg_bad1]) 
```

## Use ensemble methods to combine output of more than one models?

This is the most common approach found majorly in winning solutions of Data science competitions. This technique simply combines the result of multiple weak models and produce better results. This can be achieved through many ways:

* Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
* Boosting

To know more about these methods, you can refer article <a href="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/08/introduction-ensemble-learning/"> “Introduction to ensemble learning“ </a>.

It is always a better idea to apply ensemble methods to improve the accuracy of your model. There are two good reasons for this: 
* They are generally more complex than traditional methods 
* The traditional methods give you a good base level from which you can improve and draw from to create your ensembles.

#### Taking average of all the predictions by different base models is an example of ensemble model?


*** =instructions
- TRUE
- FALSE

*** =hint
We can combine output of different base models by:
- Taking average of all predictions
- Using maximum vote techniques

# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package

msg_bad1 = "Read more about ensemble methods"
msg_success = "Good Job!"

# Use test_mc() to grade multiple choice exercises. 
# Pass the correct option (Action, option 2 in the instructions) to correct.
# Pass the feedback messages, both positive and negative, to feedback_msgs in the appropriate order.
test_mc(1, [msg_success, msg_bad1]) 
```
