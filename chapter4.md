## The curious case of missing values

Rarely is the data captured perfectly in real world. People might not disclose few details or those details might not be available in the first place. This data set is no different. There are missing values in variables. 

We need to first find out which variables have missing values, and then see what is the best way to handle these missing values. The way to handle a missing value can depend on the number of missing values, the type of variable and the expected importance of those variables. 

So, let's start by finding out whether variable "Credit_history" has missing values or not and if so, how many observations are missing.

```{python}

train['Credit_History'].isnull().sum()

```

* isnull() helps to check the observation has missing value or not (It returns a boolean value TRUE or FALSE)
* sum() used to return the number of records have missing values

*** =instructions
- Apply isnull() to check the observation has null value or not 
- Check number of missing values is greater than 0 or not


*** =hint
Use sum() with train['Self_Employed'].isnull() to check number of missing values



*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}

# The pre-exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# Import library pandas
import pandas as pd

# Import training file
train = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/train.csv")

# Import testing file
test = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/test.csv")

```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# How many missing values in variable "Self_Employed" ?
n_missing_value_Self_Employed = train['Self_Employed']._____.sum()

# Variable Loan amount has missing values or not?
LoanAmount_have_missing_value = train['LoanAmount'].isnull().sum() > ____


```

*** =solution

```{python}

# How many missing values in variable "Self_Employed" ?
n_missing_value_Self_Employed = train['Self_Employed'].isnull().sum()

# Variable Loan amount has missing values or not?
LoanAmount_have_missing_value = train['LoanAmount'].isnull().sum() > 0


```

# How many missing values in variable "Self_Employed" ?
test_object("n_missing_value_Self_Employed", incorrect_msg='Have you checked the missing values?')

# Variable Loan amount has missing values or not?
test_object("LoanAmount_have_missing_value", incorrect_msg='Have you checked the column has missing value or not?')

success_msg("Great work!")
```

## How many variables have missing values?

Till now, we have checked the variable has missing value or not? Next action is to check how many variables have missing values. One way of doing this check would be to evaluate each individual variable. This would not be easy if we have hundred of columns. This action can be performed simply by using isnull() on dataframe object.

```{python}

train.isnull().sum()

```

This statement will return the column names with the number of observation that have missing (null) values.

## Impute missing values of LoanAmount?

There are multiple ways to fill the missing values of continuous variables, you can go with mean, median or estimate values based on other features of the data set. Here, to impute missing values of the loan amount, we would go with imputing by mean value (Mean of available values of LoanAmount).

```{python}

train['LoanAmount'].fillna(train['LoanAmount'].mean(), inplace=True)

```

*** =instructions
Impute missing values with a specific value 168





*** =hint
Use dataframe['missingcol'].fillna(225, inplace=True) to impute missing value of column 'missingcol' with 225


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}

# The pre-exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# Import library pandas
import pandas as pd

# Import training file
train = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/train.csv")

# Import testing file
test = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/test.csv")

```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# Impute missing value of LoanAmount with 168 for test data set
test['LoanAmount'].fillna(______, inplace=True)

```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Impute missing value of LoanAmount with 168 for test data set
test['LoanAmount'].fillna(168, inplace=True)

```

*** =sct

```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Impute missing value of LoanAmount with 168 for test data set
test_data_frame("test", columns=["LoanAmount"], incorrect_msg='Did you impute missing value with 168?')
success_msg("Great work!")
```

## Impute missing values of SelfEmployed?

To impute missing values of Categorical variables, we look at the frequency table and impute with value has higher frequency because there is a high probability of success. For example, if you look at the distribution of SelfEmployed 500 out of 582 which is ~86% of total values falls under the category "No". Here we will replace missing values of SelfEmployed with "No".

```{python}

train['Self_Employed'].fillna('No',inplace=True)

```

*** =instructions
- Impute missing values with more frequent category of Gender and Credit History
- Use value_counts() to check more frequent category of variable

*** =hint
- Male is more frequent in Gender
- 1 is more frequent in Credit_History


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}

# The pre-exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# Import library pandas
import pandas as pd

# Import training file
train = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/train.csv")

# Import testing file
test = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/test.csv")

```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# Impute missing value of Gender
train['Gender'].fillna(_____,inplace=True)


# Impute missing value of Credit_History
train['Credit_History'].fillna(_____,inplace=True)

```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Impute missing value of LoanAmount with median for test data set
train['Gender'].fillna('Male',inplace=True)

# Impute missing value of Credit_History
train['Credit_History'].fillna(1,inplace=True)


```

*** =sct

```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Impute missing value of LoanAmount with median for test data set
test_data_frame("train", columns=["Gender"], incorrect_msg='Did you impute missing value of Gender with Male?')

# Impute missing value of Credit_History
test_data_frame("train", columns=["Credit_History"], incorrect_msg='Did you impute missing value of Credit_History with 1?')


success_msg("Great work!")

## Treat extreme values of LoanAmount and ApplicantIncome?

Let’s analyze LoanAmount first. Since the extreme values are practically possible, i.e. some people might apply for high-value loans due to specific needs. 

```{python}

train ['LoanAmount'].hist(bins=20)

```
<center><img src="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Capture_LoanAmount.png"></center>

So instead of treating them as outliers, let’s try a log transformation to nullify their effect:

```{python}

import numpy as np
train ['LoanAmount_log'] = np.log(train['LoanAmount'])
train ['LoanAmount_log'].hist(bins=20)

```
<center><img src="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7.-loan-log.png"></center>


Now the distribution looks much closer to normal and effect of extreme values has been significantly subsided.

*** =instructions
- Add both ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome as TotalIncome
- Take log transformation of TotalIncome to deal with extreme values


*** =hint
- Add both train['ApplicantIncome'] and train['CoapplicantIncome']
- Take log of df['TotalIncome']


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}

# The pre-exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# Import library pandas
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Import training file
train = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/train.csv")

# Import testing file
test = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/test.csv")
train['TotalIncome'] = train['ApplicantIncome'] + train['CoapplicantIncome']

```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# Training and Testing datasets are loaded in variable train and test dataframe respectively

# Add both ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome to TotalIncome
train['TotalIncome'] = 

# Perform log transformation of TotalIncome to make it closer to normal
train['TotalIncome_log']=


```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Training and Testing datasets are loaded in variable train and test dataframe respectively

# Add both ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome to TotalIncome
train['TotalIncome'] = train['ApplicantIncome'] + train['CoapplicantIncome']

# Perform log transformation of TotalIncome to make it closer to normal
train['TotalIncome_log'] = np.log(train['TotalIncome'])


```

*** =sct

```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Add both ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome to TotalIncome
test_data_frame("train", columns=["TotalIncome"], incorrect_msg='Have you added both ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome?')

# Perform log transformation of TotalIncome to make it closer to normal
test_data_frame("train", columns=["TotalIncome_log"], incorrect_msg='Have you taken log of TotalIncome?')

success_msg("Great work!")
