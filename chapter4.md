## Credit History has missing value or not ?

There are missing values in variables. We should first identify the variables have missing value then estimate those values wisely depending on the amount of missing values and the expected importance of variables. So, here our first task is to check the variable has missing values in the data set and how many observation has missing values.

```{python}

train['Credit_History'].isnull().sum()

```

* isnull() helps to check the observation has missing value or not (It returns a boolean value TRUE or FALSE)
* sum() used to return the number of records have missing values

*** =instructions
- Apply isnull() to check the observation has null value or not 
- Check number of missing values is greater then 0 or not


*** =hint
Use train['Self_Employed'].isnull().sum() to check number of missing values



*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}

# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# Import library pandas
import pandas as pd

# Import training file
train = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/train.csv")

# Import testing file
test = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/test.csv")

```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# How many missing values in variable "Self_Employed" ?
n_missing_value_Self_Employed = train['Self_Employed']._____.sum()

# Variable Loan amount has missing values or not?
LoanAmount_have_missing_value = train['LoanAmount'].isnull().sum() > ____


```

*** =solution

```{python}

# How many missing values in variable "Self_Employed" ?
n_missing_value_Self_Employed = train['Self_Employed'].isnull().sum()

# Variable Loan amount has missing values or not?
LoanAmount_have_missing_value = train['LoanAmount'].isnull().sum() > 0


```

# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# How many missing values in variable "Self_Employed" ?
test_object("n_missing_value_Self_Employed")

# Variable Loan amount has missing values or not?
test_object("LoanAmount_have_missing_value")

success_msg("Great work!")

## How many variables have missing values?

Till now, we have checked the variable has missing value or not? Next action is to check how many variables has missing value. One way of doing this check for each individual variable but it would not be easy if we have hundred of columns. This action can be performed simply by using isnull() on dataframe object.

```{python}

train.isnull().sum()

```

This statement will return the columns names with number of observation having missing (null) values.

*** =instructions
Apply isnull().sum() with test dataset



*** =hint
Use test.isnull().sum() to check number of missing values



*** =pre_exercise_code

# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# Import library pandas

# Check variables have missing values in test data set
number_missing_values_test_data = _____.isnull()._____()

```

# Check variables have missing values in test data set

## Impute missing values of LoanAmount?

There are multiple ways to fill the missing values of continuous variables, you can go with mean, median or estimate values based on other features of data set. Here to impute missing values of loan amount, we would go with imputing by mean value (Mean of available values of LoanAmount).

```{python}

train['LoanAmount'].fillna(train['LoanAmount'].mean(), inplace=True)

```

*** =instructions
Impute missing values with a specific value 168





*** =hint
Use test['LoanAmount'].fillna(168, inplace=True)


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}

# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# Import library pandas
import pandas as pd

# Import training file
train = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/train.csv")

# Import testing file
test = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/test.csv")

```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# Impute missing value of LoanAmount with median for test data set
test['LoanAmount'].fillna(______, inplace=True)

```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Impute missing value of LoanAmount with median for test data set
test['LoanAmount'].fillna(168, inplace=True)

```

*** =sct

# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to

# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Impute missing value of LoanAmount with median for test data set
#test_object(“test['LoanAmount']”)

success_msg("Great work!")

## Impute missing values of SelfEmployed?

To impute missing values of Categorical variables, we look at the frquency table and impute with value has higher frequency because there is a high probability of success. For example, if you look at distribution of SelfEmployed 500 out of 582 which is ~86% of total values falls under category "No". Here we will replace missing values of SelfEmployed with "No".

```{python}

train['Self_Employed'].fillna('No',inplace=True)

```

*** =instructions
Impute missing values with more frequent category

*** =hint
- Male is more frequent in Gender
- 1 is more frequent in Credit_History


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}

# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# Import library pandas
import pandas as pd

# Import training file
train = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/train.csv")

# Import testing file
test = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/test.csv")

```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# Impute missing value of Gender
train['Gender'].fillna(_____,inplace=True)


# Impute missing value of Credit_History
train['Credit_History'].fillna(_____,inplace=True)

```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Impute missing value of LoanAmount with median for test data set
train['Gender'].fillna('Male',inplace=True)

# Impute missing value of Credit_History
train['Credit_History'].fillna(1,inplace=True)


```

test_object(“test['Gender']”)

# Impute missing value of Credit_History
test_object(“test['Credit_History']”)

## Treat extreme values of LoanAmount and ApplicantIncome?

Let’s analyze LoanAmount first. Since the extreme values are practically possible, i.e. some people might apply for high value loans due to specific needs. 

```{python}

train ['LoanAmount'].hist(bins=20)

```
<center><img src="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Capture_LoanAmount.png"></center>

So instead of treating them as outliers, let’s try a log transformation to nullify their effect:

```{python}

import numpy as np
train ['LoanAmount_log'] = np.log(train['LoanAmount'])
train ['LoanAmount_log'].hist(bins=20)

```
<center><img src="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7.-loan-log.png"></center>


Now the distribution looks much closer to normal and effect of extreme values has been significantly subsided.

*** =instructions
- Add both ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome as TotalIncome
- Take log transformation of TotalIncome to deal with extreme values


*** =hint
- df['TotalIncome'] = df['ApplicantIncome'] + df['CoapplicantIncome']
- df['TotalIncome_log'] = np.log(df['TotalIncome'])


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}

# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# Import library pandas
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Import training file
train = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/train.csv")

# Import testing file
test = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/test.csv")

```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# Training and Testing data set is loaded in variable train and test dataframe respectively

# Add both ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome to TotalIncome
train['TotalIncome'] = 

# Perform log transformation of TotalIncome to make it closer to normal
train['TotalIncome_log']=

```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Training and Testing data set is loaded in variable train and test dataframe respectively

# Add both ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome to TotalIncome
train['TotalIncome'] = train['ApplicantIncome'] + train['CoapplicantIncome']

# Perform log transformation of TotalIncome to make it closer to normal
train['TotalIncome_log'] = np.log(train['TotalIncome'])


```

```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to

# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

#test_object("train['TotalIncome']")

# Perform log transformation of TotalIncome to make it closer to normal
