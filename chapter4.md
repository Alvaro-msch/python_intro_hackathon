## Dealing with missing values

There are missing values in some variables. We should estimate those values wisely depending on the amount of missing values and the expected importance of variables.

### Identifying missing values

Imputing missing values in all the variables is important because most of the models don’t work with missing data and even if they do, imputing them helps more often than not. So, let us check the number of nulls / NaNs in the dataset for all variables.

```{python}

train.apply(lambda x: sum(x.isnull()),axis=0) 

```

Read more about lambda <a href="http://www.python-course.eu/lambda.php">here</a>.

### Imputing missing values
There are numerous ways to fill the missing values of loan amount – the simplest being replacement by mean for continuous variables, which can be done by following code:

```{python}

train['LoanAmount'].fillna(train['LoanAmount'].mean(), inplace=True)

```
And for categorical variables, we look at the frquency table and impute with value has higher frequency because there is a high probability of success. For example, if you look at distribution of Self_Employed 500 out of 582 which is ~86% of total values falls under category "No". Here we will replace missing values of Self_Employed with "No".

```{python}

df['Self_Employed'].fillna('No',inplace=True)

```

*** =instructions
- Use train.apply(lambda x: sum(x.isnull()),axis=0) with comparison operator to check variable has missing value or not
- Look at frequency distribution of Gender to identify more frequent category


*** =hint
- Use sum(train.apply(lambda x: sum(x.isnull()),axis=0) > 0) to check count of variable having missing values 
- Use median() inplace of mean() in expression train['Loan_Amount_Term'].fillna(train['Loan_Amount_Term'].median(), inplace=True) to impute with median


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}

# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# Import library pandas
import pandas as pd

# Import training file
train = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/train.csv")

# Import testing file
test = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/test.csv")

```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# Training and Testing data set is loaded in variable train and test dataframe respectively

# Number of variables with missing values
variables_missing_value = 


# Impute missing value of Loan_Amount_Term with median


# Impute missing value of Gender with more frequent category

 

```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Training and Testing data set is loaded in variable train and test dataframe respectively

# Number of variables with missing values
variables_missing_value = sum(train.apply(lambda x: sum(x.isnull()),axis=0) > 0)


# Impute missing value of Loan_Amount_Term with median
train['Loan_Amount_Term'].fillna(train['Loan_Amount_Term'].median(), inplace=True)

# Impute missing value of Gender with more frequent category
train['Self_Employed'].fillna('No',inplace=True)

```

## Treat extreme values of LoanAmount and ApplicantIncome?

Let’s analyze LoanAmount first. Since the extreme values are practically possible, i.e. some people might apply for high value loans due to specific needs. So instead of treating them as outliers, let’s try a log transformation to nullify their effect:

```{python}

import numpy as np
train ['LoanAmount_log'] = np.log(train['LoanAmount'])
train ['LoanAmount_log'].hist(bins=20)

```

Now the distribution looks much closer to normal and effect of extreme values has been significantly subsided.

*** =instructions
- Combine both ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome as TotalIncome
- Take log transformation of TotalIncome to deal with extreme values


*** =hint
- df['TotalIncome'] = df['ApplicantIncome'] + df['CoapplicantIncome']
- df['TotalIncome_log'] = np.log(df['TotalIncome'])


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}

# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# Import library pandas
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Import training file
train = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/train.csv")

# Import testing file
test = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/test.csv")

```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# Training and Testing data set is loaded in variable train and test dataframe respectively

# Add both ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome to TotalIncome
train['TotalIncome'] = 

# Perform log transformation of TotalIncome to make it closer to normal
train['TotalIncome_log']=

```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Training and Testing data set is loaded in variable train and test dataframe respectively

# Add both ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome to TotalIncome
train['TotalIncome'] = train['ApplicantIncome'] + train['CoapplicantIncome']

# Perform log transformation of TotalIncome to make it closer to normal
train['TotalIncome_log'] = np.log(train['TotalIncome'])


```

# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Add both ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome to TotalIncome
#test_object("train['TotalIncome']")

# Perform log transformation of TotalIncome to make it closer to normal

## Data preparation for building a predictive model?

In Python, Scikit-Learn (sklearn) is the most commonly used library for model building. I encourage you to get a refresher on sklearn through this <a href="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/01/scikit-learn-python-machine-learning-tool/">article</a>. It has gathered a lot of interest recently as a choice of language for data analysis. There are few pre-requisite for scikit learn library:

* Treat missing values
* All inputs must be numeric
 
To convert all non-numeric variables to number, following code will help:

```{python}

from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
var_mod = ['Gender','Married','Dependents','Education','Self_Employed','Property_Area','Loan_Status']
le = LabelEncoder()
for i in var_mod:
    train[i] = le.fit_transform(train[i])

```

*** =instructions
- Impute missing values of categorical variables with higher frequent categories of variable
- Impute missing values of continuous variables with mean
- Convert all non-numeric variables to numbers


*** =hint
- df['TotalIncome'] = df['ApplicantIncome'] + df['CoapplicantIncome']
- df['TotalIncome_log'] = np.log(df['TotalIncome'])


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}

# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# Import library pandas
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Import training file
train = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/train.csv")

# Import testing file
test = pd.read_csv("https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/av-datahack-datacamp/test.csv")

```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# Training and Testing data set is loaded in variable train and test dataframe respectively

# Impute missing values for Gender


# Impute missing values for Married


# Impute missing values for Dependents


# Impute missing values for Loan_Amount


# Impute missing values for Credit_History


# Convert all non-numeric values to number


```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Training and Testing data set is loaded in variable train and test dataframe respectively

# Impute missing values for Gender
train['Gender'].fillna('Male',inplace=True)

# Impute missing values for Married
train['Married'].fillna('Yes',inplace=True)

# Impute missing values for Dependents
train['Dependents'].fillna('0',inplace=True)

# Impute missing values for Loan_Amount
train['LoanAmount'].fillna(train['LoanAmount'].mean(), inplace=True)

# Impute missing values for Credit_History
train['Credit_History'].fillna(1.0,inplace=True)

# Convert all non-numeric values to number
var_mod = ['Gender','Married','Dependents','Education','Self_Employed','Property_Area','Loan_Status']
le = LabelEncoder()
for i in var_mod:
    train[i] = le.fit_transform(train[i])


```
