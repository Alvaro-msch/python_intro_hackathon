## Why learn Python for data analysis?

Python (an interpreted language) has gathered a lot of interest recently as a choice of language for data analysis. Here are some reasons which go in favour of learning Python:

* Open Source â€“ free to install and use
* Awesome online community - latest algorithms come to Python in a matter of days
* Easy to learn
* Can become a common language for data science and production of web-based analytics products

####Which of the following is not a reason to learn Python for Data Analysis?


*** =instructions
- Python is easy to learn.
- Python is interpreted language, hence the computation times can be high compared to compiler based languages in some cases.
- Python has good libraries for data science.
- It is production ready language (from web & software perspective).

*** =hint
Interpreted languages are typically easier to learn, but take longer computational time than compiler based languages. 

*** =pre_exercise_code


*** =sct
```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package

msg_bad1 = "That is a good reason to learn Python! Think again"
msg_success = "Exactly! Since Python is an interpreted language, the computation times can be on the higher side compared to other compiler based language."

# Use test_mc() to grade multiple choice exercises. 
# Pass the correct option (Action, option 2 in the instructions) to correct.
# Pass the feedback messages, both positive and negative, to feedback_msgs in the appropriate order.
test_mc(2, [msg_bad1, msg_success, msg_bad1, msg_bad1]) 
```

## Python 2.7 vs. Python 3.5?

You will come across this question soon after you start using Python. Both the ecosystems have their pros and cons.

**Benefits of Python 2.7**

* Awesome online community. Easier to find answers when you get stuck at places.
* Tonnes of third party libraries

**Benefits of Python 3.5**

* Cleaner and faster
* It is the future!

####Which version of Python would you recommend if you need to use several third party libraries?


*** =instructions
- Python 2.7
- Python 3.5
- Should work on both

*** =hint
If you need several third party tools, you should look for a version which has higher community support and integrations.

*** =pre_exercise_code


*** =sct
```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package

msg_bad1 = "Python 3.5 is newer and has lesser third party packages"
msg_success = "Python 2.7 has much higher compatibility with third party libraries."
msg_bad2 = "Think again! One of them is better than the other in this scenario"

# Use test_mc() to grade multiple choice exercises. 
# Pass the correct option (Action, option 2 in the instructions) to correct.
# Pass the feedback messages, both positive and negative, to feedback_msgs in the appropriate order.
test_mc(1, [msg_success, msg_bad1, msg_bad2]) 
```

## How to install Python?

While DataCamp provides an awesome interface to get you started, you will need to run a local instance of Python for any serious Data Science work. The simplest way would be to download <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads"> Anaconda</a>. It consists of most of the libraries you would need and removes any version conflicts.
I strongly recommend this for beginners. For this course, we will be using Python 3.x


####Have you installed a local instance of Python on your machine?


*** =instructions
- Yes
- No
- I need some help

*** =hint
Download <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads"> Anaconda</a>

*** =pre_exercise_code


*** =sct
```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package

msg_bad = "You should install a Python instance locally before going forward"
msg_success = "Great! You are all set to go ahead"
msg_help = "Drop us a line at help@analyticsvidhya.com"

# Use test_mc() to grade multiple choice exercises. 
# Pass the correct option (Action, option 2 in the instructions) to correct.
# Pass the feedback messages, both positive and negative, to feedback_msgs in the appropriate order.
test_mc(1, [msg_success, msg_bad, msg_help]) 
```

## Run a few simple programs in Python

Time to get our hands dirty now. We will use Python to run some simple programs!

*** =instructions
- The first line just adds 2 numbers (1 & 2). Write a simple program to add number 3 and number 4 and assign it to a variable addition2
- Print "Hello World!" on the console


*** =hint
- Think how would you write simple addition.
- Make sure you assign the sum to the variable 'addition2'
- Remember that the message to be printed should be enclosed in " "
- Remember - Python is case sensitive. Check your cases and white spaces

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
# The pre-exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:
```

*** =sample_code
```{python}
# Add 1 & 2 and assign it to addition
addition = 1 + 2
# Now write a code to add 3 & 4 and assign to addition2


# Print a message
print("Welcome to the joint course from Analytics Vidhya and DataCamp")

# Now write a code to Print "Hello World!"

```


*** =solution
```{python}
# Add 1 & 2 and assign it to addition
addition = 1 + 2
# Now write a code to add 3 & 4 and assign to addition2
addition2 = 3 + 4

# Print a message
print("Welcome to the joint course from Analytics Vidhya and DataCamp")

# Now write a code to Print "Hello World!"
print("Hello World!")
```

*** =sct
```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Check if the student typed 3 + 4
test_object("addition2")

# Check if the student printed "Hello World!"
test_output_contains("Hello World!", pattern = False, no_output_msg="Did you print Hello World! ?")
success_msg("Great work!")
```
