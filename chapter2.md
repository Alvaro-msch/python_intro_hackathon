## Create a List

Lists are probably the most versatile data structures in Python. A list can be defined by writing a list of comma separated values in square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types. Python lists are mutable - individual elements of a list can be changed while the identity does not change.

```{python}
Country =['INDIA','USA','GERMANY','UK','AUSTRALIA']

Temperature =[44, 28, 20, 18, 25, 45, 67]
```
We just created two lists, one for Country names (strings) and another one for Temperature data (whole numbers). 

####Accessing individual elements of a list
- Individual elements of a list can be accessed by writing an index number in square bracket. The first index of a list starts with 0 (zero) not 1. For example, Country[0] can be used to access the first element, 'INDIA'
- A range of elements can be accessed by using start index and end index but it does not return the value of the end index. For example, Temperature[1:4] returns three elements, the second through fourth elements [28, 20, 18], but not the fifth element

*** =instructions
- Create a list of the first five odd numbers and store it in the variable odd_numbers
- Print second to fourth element [1, 4, 9] from squares_list


*** =hint
- Use AV[0] to select the first element of a list AV. 
- Use AV[1:3] to select the second to the third element of a list AV.

# Now write a line of code to create a list of the first five odd numbers and store it in a variable odd_numbers
odd_numbers=

# Print the first element of squares_list
print (squares_list[0])

# Print the second to fourth elements of squares_list

```

*** =solution
```{python}

# Create a list of squared numbers
squares_list = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Now write a code to create list of first five odd numbers and store it in a variable odd_numbers
odd_numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

# Print the first element of squares_list
print (squares_list[0])

# Print the second to fourth elements of squares_list
print (squares_list[1:4])
```

## Create a String

Strings can simply be defined by use of single ( ‘ ), double ( ” ) or triple ( ”’ ) inverted commas. Strings enclosed in triple quotes ( ”’ ) can span over multiple lines. Note that Python strings are immutable, so you can not change the contents of a string.

```{python}
String =" String elements can also be accessed using index numbers, just like lists"

print (String[0:8])

#Above print command display Strings on screen.

```


*** =instructions

- Use the len() function to store the length of string
- Use start and end index to access the required characters, e.g. str[0:3] to return first three characters of string str
- '+' operator is used to concatenate (combine) two strings



*** =hint

- Use str[0] to select the first element of string str 
- Use str1 + str2 to return the concatenated result of both strings str1 and str2



*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}
# The pre-exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:
```

*** =sample_code

```{python}
# Create a string str1
str1 = "Introduction with strings"

# Now store the length of string str1 in variable str_len 
str_len =

# Print last seven characters of string str1


str2 = "I am doing a course Introduction to Hackathon using "
str3 = "Python"

# Write a line of code to store concatenated string of str2 and str3 into variable str4
str4 =

```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Create a string str1
str1 = "Introduction with strings"

# Now store the length of string str1 in varible str_len 
str_len=len(str1)

# Print last seven characters of string str1
print (str1[18:25])

str2 = "I am doing a course Introduction to Hackathon using "
str3 = "Python"

# Write a code to store concatenated string of str2 and str3 into variable str4
str4= str2 + str3
```

*** =sct

```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Check length of strings
test_object("str_len", incorrect_msg = "Did you use len() function with str1?")

# Check last seven characters
test_output_contains("strings", pattern = False, no_output_msg="Have you used the right start and end index number with str1 to print the last seven characters?")

# Check concatenated strings"
test_object("str3", incorrect_msg="Are you sure that you have used + sign to concatenate both strings st2 and str3")
success_msg("Great work!")
```

## Create a Dictionary

A Dictionary is an unordered set of key:value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within a Dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}.

```{python}
DICT = {'Name':'Kunal', 'Company':'Analytics Vidhya'}

#Dictionary elements can be accessed by keys

print (DICT['Name'])

#The above print statement will print Kunal

```

In dictionary "DICT", Name and Company are dictionary keys whereas "Kunal" and "Analytics Vidhya" are their respective values.

*** =instructions

- Use the format dictionary['key'] to access value(s) of key - e.g DICT['Company'] will return "Analytics Vidhya'
- DICT.keys() will return all the keys of given dictionary "DICT"


*** =hint

- Use dict['Key'] = new_value to update the existing value


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}
# The pre-exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:
```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# Create a dictionary dict1
dict1 = { 'Age': 16, 'Name': 'Max', 'Sports': 'Cricket'}

# Update the value of Age to 18
dict1['Age'] = 18

# Print the value of Age


# Print all the keys of dictionary dict1


```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Create a dictionary
dict1 = {'Age': 16, 'Name': 'Max', 'Sports': 'Cricket'}

# Update the value of Age to 18
dict1['Age'] = 18

# Print the value of Age
print (dict1['Age'])

# Print all the keys of dictionary dict
print (dict1.keys())

```

*** =sct

```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Check value of Age
test_output_contains("18", pattern = False, no_output_msg="Have you used the key Age with dictonary dict1")

# Check keys of dictionary
test_output_contains("dict_keys(['Age', 'Name', 'Sports'])", pattern=True, no_output_msg="Have you used keys() with dict to print all keys?")

success_msg("Great work!")
```

## How to use Python libraries?
First of all - great progress! You now know some of the important data structures in Python.

Let's take another step ahead in our journey to learn Python, by getting acquainted with some useful libraries. The first step is to learn to import them into your environment. There are several ways of doing so in Python:

```{python}
import math as m

from math import *
```

In the first manner, we have defined an alias m to library math. We can now use various functions from math library (e.g. factorial) by referencing it using the alias m.factorial().

In the second manner, you have imported the entire name space in math i.e. you can directly use factorial() without referring to math.

Following are a list of libraries, you will need for any scientific computations and data analysis:

* <a href="http://www.numpy.org/"> Numpy </a>
* <a href="https://www.scipy.org/"> Scipy </a>
* <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/"> Pandas </a>
* <a href="http://matplotlib.org/"> Matplotlib </a>
* <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/"> Scikit Learn </a>



##### Which of the following is a valid import statement for below code?
```{python}
print (factorial(5))
```

*** =instructions
- import math
- from math import factorial
- import math.factorial

*** =hint
Python's from statement lets you import specific attributes from a module into the current namespace.

*** =pre_exercise_code


*** =sct
```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package

msg_bad = "Read about importing libraries in python"
msg_success = "Good Job!"

# Use test_mc() to grade multiple choice exercises. 
# Pass the correct option (Action, option 2 in the instructions) to correct.
# Pass the feedback messages, both positive and negative, to feedback_msgs in the appropriate order.
test_mc(2, [msg_bad, msg_success, msg_bad]) 
```

## Why are conditional statements required?

Conditional statements are used to execute code fragments based on a given condition. The most commonly used construct is if-else, with the following syntax:

```{python}

if [condition]:
  __execution if true__
else:
  __execution if false__ 
```

*** =instructions

- Store the length of `squares_list` to `square_len` using function `len()`
- Comparision operators `<, >, <=, >=, ==` and `!=` help to check condition is true or false
- Write the outcome in each branch of the following conditional code

*** =hint

- Use <, >, <=, >=, == and != for comparison
- Use `len(list)` to return  length of string


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}
# The pre-exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:
```

*** =sample_code

```{python}
# Create a two integer variables a and b
a=3
b=4

# if a is greater than b print a-b else a+b
if a > b:
    print (a-b)
else:
    print (a+b)

# Create a list of squared numbers
squares_list = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Store the length of squares_list in square_len
square_len = 

# if square_len is less than 5 then print "Less than 5" else "Greater than 5"
if square_len < 5:
    print ("__________")
else:
    print ("__________")


```

*** =solution

```{python}
# Create a two integer variables a and b
a=3
b=4

# if a is greater than b print a-b else a+b
if a > b:
    print (a-b)
else:
    print (a+b)

# Create a list of squared numbers
squares_list = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Store the length of squares_list in square_len
square_len = len(squares_list)

# if square_len is less than 5 then print "Less than 5" else "Greater than 5"
if square_len < 5:
    print ("Less than 5")
else:
    print ("Greater than 5")

```

# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Check length of strings
test_object("square_len", incorrect_msg = "Have you used len function with list squares_list?")

# Check last seven characters
test_output_contains("Greater than 5", pattern = False, no_output_msg="Have you given the right statement in True and False block of if statement ?")

success_msg("Great work!")

## How iterative statements help?

Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well. Repeated execution of a set of statements is called iteration.

Like most languages, Python also has a FOR-loop which is the most widely used method for iteration. It has a simple syntax:

```{python}

for i in [Python Iterable]:
  expression(i)

```
“Python Iterable” can be a list or other advanced data structures which we will explore in later sections. Let’s take a look at a simple example, determining the factorial of a number.

*** =instructions

- Iterate over all values of list using for loop
- Use % modulus operator to return remainder e.g. 4%2 will result in 0 and 5%2 to 1



*** =hint

- Write an expression x % 2 == 0 to check x is even or not


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}
# The pre-exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:
```

*** =sample_code

```{python}
# Create a list of first five numbers
ls=[]
for x in range(5):
    ls.append(x)
    
sum=0
# Store sum all the even numbers of the list ls in sum

for x in ls: 
    if ______: 
        sum += x

print (sum)

```

*** =solution

```{python}
# Create a list with first five numbers
ls=[]
for x in range(5):
    ls.append(x) # append a value to a list
    
sum=0
# Store sum all even numbers of the list ls in sum

for x in ls: 
    if x%2==0: 
        sum += x

print (sum)

```

*** =sct

```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Check length of strings
test_object("sum", incorrect_msg="Are you taking sum of even numbers?")


success_msg("Great work! Let's move to the next chapter")
