## Create a list

List is one of the most versatile data structure in Python. A list can simply be defined by writing a list of comma separated values in square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types. Python lists are mutable and individual elements of a list can be changed.

*** =instructions
- Individual elements of a list can be accessed by writting an index number in square bracket. First index of list starts with 0 (zero) not 1.
- A range of element can be accessed by having start index and end index


*** =hint
- Use AV[0] to select the first element of a list AV. 
- Use AV[-1] to select the last element of a list AV. 
- Use AV[1:3] to select second to fourth elements of a list AV.


*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:
```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# Create a list of squared numbers
squares_list = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Now write a code to create list of odd numbers and store it into a variable odd_numbers
odd_numbers=

# Print first element of squares_list
print (squares_list[0])

# Write a code to store fouth element of squares_list in variable fourth_value
fourth_value=

# Print second to fourth elements of squares_list

```

*** =solution
```{python}

# Create a list of squared numbers
squares_list = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Now write a code to create list of first five odd numbers and store it into a variable odd_numbers
odd_numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

# Print first element of squares_list
print (squares_list[0])

# Write a code to store fouth element of squares_list in variable fourth_value
fourth_value=squares_list[3]

# Print second to fourth elements of squares_list
print (squares_list[1:3])
```

*** =sct
```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Check list odd_numbers
test_object("odd_numbers")

# Check fourth value of squares_list
test_object("fourth_value")

# Check second to fourth elements"

## Create a String

Strings can simply be defined by use of single ( ‘ ), double ( ” ) or triple ( ”’ ) inverted commas. Strings enclosed in tripe quotes ( ”’ ) can span over multiple lines and are used frequently in docstrings (Python’s way of documenting functions). \ is used as an escape character. Please note that Python strings are immutable, so you can not change part of strings.

*** =instructions

- Strings can be simply defined by single ('), double (") or triple (''') quotation.
- Strings characters can be accessed using index number (similar like list)
- Strings can be concatenated with other strings



*** =hint

- Use str[2] to select the third element of string str. 
- Use len(str) to return the length of string
- Use str1 + str2 to return the concatenated result of both strings str1 and str2



*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}
# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:
```

*** =sample_code

```{python}
# Create a string str
str1 = "Introduction with strings"

# Now store the length of string in varible str_len 
str_len =

# Print last seven characters of strings str

str1 = "I am doing a course Introduction to Hackathon using "
str2 = "Python"

# Write a code to store concatenated string of str1 and str2 into variable str3
str3 =
```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Create a string str
str1 = "Introduction with strings"

# Now store the length of string in varible str_len 
str_len=len(str1)

# Print last seven characters of strings str
print (str1[18:25])

str1 = "I am doing a course Introduction to Hackathon using "
str2 = "Python"

# Write a code to store concatenated string of str1 and str2 into variable str3
str3= str1 + str2
```

*** =sct

```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Check length of strings
test_object("str_len")

# Check last seven characters
test_output_contains("strings", pattern = False)

# Check concatenated strings"
test_object("str3")
success_msg("Great work!")
```

## Create Tuples

A tuple is represented by a number of values separated by commas. Tuples are immutable and the output is surrounded by parentheses so that nested tuples are processed correctly. Additionally, even though tuples are immutable, they can hold mutable data if needed.

Since Tuples are immutable and can not change, they are faster in processing as compared to lists. Hence, if your list is unlikely to change, you should use tuples, instead of lists.

*** =instructions

- Because tuples are sequences, indexing and slicing work the same way for tuples as they do for strings
- Tuples respond to the + and * operators much like strings except that the result is a new tuple, not a string.

*** =hint

- Use tup[3] to select the fourth element of tuple tup. 
- Use tup*n to return tuple value n times


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}
# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:
```

*** =sample_code

```{python}
# Create a tuple
tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000)

# print the third element of tuple tup1 


tup2=('AV')
# Print tup2 six times

```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Create a tuple
tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000)

# print the third element of tuple tup1 
print (tup1[2])


tup2=('AV')
# Print tup2 six times
print (tup2*6)

```

*** =sct

```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Check third element of tuples
test_output_contains("1997", pattern = False)

# Check last seven characters
test_output_contains("AVAVAVAVAVAV", pattern = False)

success_msg("Great work!")
```

## Create Dictionary

Dictionary is an unordered set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}.

*** =instructions

- To access dictionary elements, you can use the familiar square brackets along with the key to obtain its value
- Dictionary can be updated by adding a new entry or a key-value pair, modifying or deleting an existing entry

*** =hint

- Use dict['Keys'] = new_value to update the existing value
- Use dict.keys() to access all keys of dictionary dict
- Use dict.values() to access all values of dictionary dict


*** =pre_exercise_code

```{python}
# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:
```

*** =sample_code

```{python}

# Create a dictionary
dict1 = {'Name': 'Max', 'Age': 16, 'Sports': 'Cricket'}

# Update the value of Age to 18


# Print the value of Age


# Return all the keys of dictionary dict1


```

*** =solution

```{python}

# Create a dictionary
dict1 = {'Name': 'Max', 'Age': 16, 'Sports': 'Cricket'}

# Update the value of Age to 18
dict1['Age'] = 18

# Print the value of Age
print (dict1['Age'])

# Print all the keys of dictionary dict
print (dict1.values())

```

*** =sct

```{python}
# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Check value of Age
test_output_contains("18", pattern = False)

# Check keys of dictionary
test_output_contains("['Age', 'Name', 'Sports']", pattern = True)

success_msg("Great work!")
```

## Plot the movies yourself

Do you remember the plot of the last exercise? Let's make an even cooler plot!

A dataset of movies, `movies`, is available in the workspace.

*** =instructions
- The first function, `np.unique()`, uses the `unique()` function of the `numpy` package to get integer values for the movie genres. You don't have to change this code, just have a look!
- Import `pyplot` in the `matplotlib` package. Set an alias for this import: `plt`.
- Use `plt.scatter()` to plot `movies.runtime` onto the x-axis, `movies.rating` onto the y-axis and use `ints` for the color of the dots. You should use the first and second positional argument, and the `c` keyword.
- Show the plot using `plt.show()`.

*** =hint
- You don't have to program anything for the first instruction, just take a look at the first line of code.
- Use `import ___ as ___` to import `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`.
- Use `plt.scatter(___, ___, c = ___)` for the third instruction.
- You'll always have to type in `plt.show()` to show the plot you created.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
# The pre exercise code runs code to initialize the user's workspace. You can use it for several things:

# 1. Preload a dataset. The code below will read the csv that is stored at the URL's location.
# The movies variable will be available in the user's console.
import pandas as pd
movies = pd.read_csv("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/introduction_to_r/movies.csv")

# 2. Preload a package
import numpy as np
```

*** =sample_code
```{python}
# Get integer values for genres
_, ints = np.unique(movies.genre, return_inverse = True)

# Import matplotlib.pyplot


# Make a scatter plot: runtime on  x-axis, rating on y-axis and set c to ints


# Show the plot

```

*** =solution
```{python}
# Get integer values for genres
_, ints = np.unique(movies.genre, return_inverse = True)

# Import matplotlib.pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Make a scatter plot: runtime on  x-axis, rating on y-axis and set c to ints
plt.scatter(movies.runtime, movies.rating, c=ints)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

# The sct section defines the Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) used to
# evaluate the student's response. All functions used here are defined in the 
# pythonwhat Python package. Documentation can also be found at github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat/wiki

# Check if the student changed the np.unique() call
# If it's not called, we know the student removed the call.
# If it's called incorrectly, we know the student changed the call.
test_function("numpy.unique",
              not_called_msg = "Don't remove the call of `np.unique` to define `ints`.",
              incorrect_msg = "Don't change the call of `np.unique` to define `ints`.")
# Check if the student removed the ints object
test_object("ints",
            undefined_msg = "Don't remove the definition of the predefined `ints` object.",
            incorrect_msg = "Don't change the definition of the predefined `ints` object.")

# Check if the student imported matplotlib.pyplot like the solution
# Let automatic feedback message generation handle the feedback messages
test_import("matplotlib.pyplot", same_as = True)

# Check whether the student used the scatter() function correctly
# If it's used, but incorrectly, tell them to check the instructions again
test_function("matplotlib.pyplot.scatter",
              incorrect_msg = "You didn't use `plt.scatter()` correctly, have another look at the instructions.")

# Check if the student called the show() function
# Let automatic feedback message generation handle all feedback messages
test_function("matplotlib.pyplot.show")

success_msg("Great work!")
